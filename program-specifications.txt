    - analog speaker

    -- objectives -- 
  - device initialization
      - turn off watchdog timer
      - oscillator 
          - default operating frequency (2.0MHz) of C8051F005
      - port 
          - crossbar (XBARE) and weak pull-ups enabled
          - port 1 (P1) 
              - P1.0 configured as output push-pull
              - P1.1-7 configured as output open-drain 
      - timer 1
          - timer 1 interrupt enabled
          - timer 1 in mode 2 
          - timer 1 high byte loaded (100us count) 

  - device routines
      - global interrupt enable/disable 
      - timer 1 start/stop 

  - timer 1 interrupt service routine 
      - toggles P1.0 bit that is connected to speaker through MOSFET.
      - this happens with variable frequency to create the effect of siren 
        sound.
