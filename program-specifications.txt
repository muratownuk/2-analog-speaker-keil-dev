    - analog speaker

    -- objectives -- 
  - device initialization
      - turn off watchdog timer
      - oscillator 
          - chip operating frequency of 16.0MHz (internal - C8051F005) 
      - timer 3 
          - timer 3 interrupt enabled 
          - timer 3 in auto-reload mode  
          - timer 3 uses SYSCLK as timebase 
          - takes reload value as parameter 
      - Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) 
          - enable DAC (DAC0CN) 
          - left-justified mode 
          - enable internal Vref-2.4V (REF0CN) and bias as refrerence voltage 
            and bias to DAC (necessary for DAC operation).   

  - device routines
      - global interrupt enable/disable 
      - timer 3 start/stop 

  - timer 1 interrupt service routine 
      - toggles P1.0 bit that is connected to speaker through MOSFET.
      - this happens with variable frequency to create the effect of siren 
        sound.
